The aim of this paper is to describe a quadratic algorithm for computing the equation
K-automaton of a regular K-expression as defined by Lombardy and Sakarovitch. Our construction
is based on an extension to regular K-expressions of the notion of c-continuation that we introduced
to compute the equation automaton of a regular expression as a quotient of its position automaton.
